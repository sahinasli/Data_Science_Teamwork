- Personal Questions 
- Any challenges (Classes, Coding, studying, etc.) 
- How you’re studying, you need personal advice? 
- Remember that practice makes perfect. 
- What exactly each student does for the team, if they know each other, if they care for each other, if they follow and talk with each other etc.

(The problems and subjects in this part, has been prepared especially for you to equip yourself for the interview process and improve your coding skills. 
To get the most from this part, it’s highly recommended to be prepared and present the topics in English/German.
We strongly advise you to force yourself to present especially the interview questions in English/German. 
The main and only aim of this part is to develop your skills that you need during and after the recruitment process and make you ready for the ML career.)
